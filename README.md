The Motive of the Program: This program asks the user for name, age and status of their registration to vote. If they are of age 18 or older, the program will prompt the question of status. If the user is registered, the program prints that they may vote. If they are not registered, the program will prompt the user to register to vote. Finally, if the user is younger than the age of 18, the program will prompt that they are too young.

How to Use the Program: The program is fairly simple to use. The user will be prompted a series of questions. The user then needs to answer the questions correctly and press the Enter key.

Contribution: The program can be contributed through the Github user Urjeet Deshmukh's repository. The link to the repository is as follows: https://github.com/urjeet/urd1-week-6-lab. Contributions can be requested and will be approved as quickly as possible.
